# Calculots
_The most useful, lightweight calculator application I can make, for simple math and equations._

I made this for two main reasons:
1. The default Windows calculator app is severely limited for practical use. The history is unintuitive, typing is weird, and more complex equations just aren't feasible.
2. I don't want to have to open https://www.desmos.com/scientific in a browser every time I need to compute an equation. I suppose that's just another symptom of my distaste for the browser-oriented user experience.

The goal, therefore, is to provide a very fast, lightweight calculator that can do simple math as easily as possible, while also providing features for advanced mathematical expression formatting, such as nested fractions, variables with super- and sub-scripts, integrals, square roots, and more. Eventually graphing capabilities will be added as well.

### Technologies
This project will be built using Java 12, and will make use of JavaFX 2.0 for its user interface components.
